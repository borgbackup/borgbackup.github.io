Support
=======

Please first read the docs, the existing issues in the issue tracker, and mailing
list posts — a lot of topics are already documented, explained, discussed,
and filed there.

.. _docs:

Documentation
-------------

We have quite nice docs, including:

- installation
- reference for Borg commands
- examples and an FAQ
- internals documentation
- docs for developers

.. _issue_tracker:

Issue Tracker
-------------

If you've found a bug or have a concrete feature request, please create a new
ticket on the project's `issue tracker
<https://www.github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues>`_.

For more general questions or discussions, the IRC channel or the mailing list is preferred.

.. _chat_irc:

Chat (IRC)
----------

Join us in the #borgbackup channel on libera.chat.

As usual on IRC, just ask or tell directly and then patiently wait for replies.
Stay connected.

Using an IRC client and a registered nick is the preferred way to use our channel.

During times of high spam activity, a registered nick might even be required to
join our channel.

You can also use the web-based IRC client; choose a nickname and join our
channel (you might still need a registered nick to join our channel; see above):

`#borgbackup channel web IRC <https://web.libera.chat/?nick=Guest&#borgbackup>`_

.. _matrix:

Matrix Chat
-----------

You can also use a Matrix-protocol-based chat client, such as
`Element <https://app.element.io>`_, to join the
`#borgbackup room <https://matrix.to/#/!KnTJxMbCJuuVyjTSeJ:libera.chat?via=libera.chat&via=matrix.org&via=rudd-o.com>`_.

Note: This room is bridged to the #borgbackup IRC channel on libera.chat.

.. _mailing_list:

Mailing list
------------

To learn about the mailing list—its topic, how to subscribe or unsubscribe, and
where you can find the list archives—see the
`mailing list homepage
<https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/borgbackup>`_.

.. _twitter:

.. _mastodon:

Mastodon / Twitter / X
-----------------------

Follow us there for announcements:

- Mastodon: https://fosstodon.org/@borgbackup
- Twitter/X: https://twitter.com/borgbackup

Please note that Twitter/X and Mastodon are not suitable for longer/more
complex discussions—use one of the other channels for that.

.. _bounties_and_fundraisers:

Donations, Bounties and Fundraisers
-----------------------------------
