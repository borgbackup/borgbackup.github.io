Donations, Bounties and Fundraisers
===================================

Overview
--------

Please help the software projects you use and love.

You can support the BorgBackup project using these options:

- `PayPal donation to Waldmann EDV <https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=58A7SUQJZLBQ8>`_
- `BorgBackup team on Liberapay <https://liberapay.com/borgbackup/donate>`_
- `BorgBackup GitHub Sponsors <https://github.com/sponsors/borgbackup>`_
- `BorgBackup on Open Collective <https://opencollective.com/borgbackup>`_

PayPal
------

PayPal donations may be the easiest way (if you already use PayPal or a credit card)
to directly support a specific developer.

Waldmann EDV is the company of Thomas Waldmann, BorgBackup's lead developer and maintainer.

Liberapay
---------

On Liberapay, you can become a patron and support us regularly to
help make the project sustainable in the long term.

The funds are distributed to the BorgBackup team members, and as a BorgBackup
developer, you can join the team.

GitHub Sponsors and Open Collective
-----------------------------------

On GitHub, you can become a sponsor and support us regularly, or alternatively
make a one-time donation.

Those funds are then transferred to Open Collective Europe (OC EU), our fiscal host.

You can also contribute directly via Open Collective; those funds also go to OC EU.

The funds held by OC EU on our behalf can be used to pay miscellaneous project-related expenses
submitted by BorgBackup team members.
